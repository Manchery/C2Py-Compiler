# C to Python Translator

Jialong Wu, Yishujie Zhao and Shuwei Huang

## Introduction

A C to Python translator ðŸ¤– based on Lex/Yacc.

Course project for Principles of Assembly and Compilation, instructed by [Prof. Wang](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~wangchaokun/).

For details, see our report and slides (in Chinese).

## Features ðŸ”¥

### Basic Syntax of C

Support:

- Variable and literal
- Arithmetic and logical expression
- Conditional and loop statements
- One-dimensional array
- Function

Not support:

- Pointer and reference
- `continue` and `break`
- `do-while` statement
- Conditions like `if (a)` (must be `if (a!=0)`) 

### Library Functions

Standard library functions, including:

- `scanf`
- `printf`
- `atoi`
- `strlen`

Their Python equivalents are implemented in `utils.py`.

### Semantic Error Handling

Detect and report semantic errors, including:

- Redefinition of variables, arrays and functions
- Undefined identifiers

All semantic errors will be accumulated and reported in the end of compilation.

### Scope check and renaming for variables

We maintain a symbol table in order to do scope check and renaming of variables. For details, have a try to compile `examples/test.c`.

## Environment

Ubuntu 16.04+ with Lex, Yacc, and Python 3.7 
## Usage

```
make clean
make
./parser [Input C File]
python out.py
```

The default input file is `in.c` and results will be written to `out.py`. 

## Examples

There are more examples in `src/examples`:

- `calc/calc.c`: Expression evaluation
- `aplusb.c`: A+B Problem & HelloWorld
- `factorial.c`: Solving factorial
- `palindrome.c`: Palindrome Validation
- `special.c`: Example for semantic errors
- `test.c`: Example for variables renaming

For details, please refer to our report.
